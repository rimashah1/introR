# bookdown.ipynb
This folder follows an Intro to R tutorial, which can be found at https://bookdown.org/vaabe/bookdown-demo/the-r-environment.html. For chapter 3, the tutorial used a dataset that is no longer available so the paygap dataset was used for these exercises. The paygap data is however not suited for some exercises so adjustments were made.
